# Node2Exe

This project aims to make it easier to port, and to distribute your Node.js applications to Windows users.

## How does it works ?
The launcher that will simultaneously launch Node.js and a browser Window wired to your local server.

The Node.js Portable Executable is not included in the source. It can be downloaded here : https://sourceforge.net/projects/nodejsportable/

You need to put it in the same folder as Launcher.exe in order to make it work.

The browser windows uses Awesomium.NET, for more informations check : http://www.awesomium.com/
